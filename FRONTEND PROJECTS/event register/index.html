        Robotic process automation (RPA) is a software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage software robots that emulate humans actions interacting with digital systems and software.
        RPA is used to automate various supply chain processes, including data entry, predictive maintenance and after-sales service support. RPA is used across industries to automate high volume, rote tasks. Telecommunications companies use RPA to configure new services and the associated billing systems for new accounts.
        RPA Developers are among the highest-paid professionals in the information technology industry. Because most businesses are automating their business processes, these professionals are in high demand.

        <p>RPA software bots operate 24/7 without breaks to take over manual tasks, and they're more efficient at managing these repetitive tasks than humans. RPA reduces human errors that may lead to costly rework and speeds up the time to value, meaning people have more time to spend on value-driven work.</p>
